You found the secret stash! I knew you were smart and good at things!

Luckily for you there's more to find! This CTF is, shall we say, unique. Most CTFs are about solving compartmentalized challenges to find flags. This CTF is more of a treasure hunt to find out how to submit the flags in the first place! Flags will be red herrings that mark dead ends; a flag will never be part of a solution to the treasure hunt. 

I did my best to include hints for the more difficult phases of the treasure hunt, so hopefully you don't get stuck. Don't stress about finding all the flags as you're completing the treasure hunt; you can always go back later, and there will be hints at the end (not that you would need them, of course).

Keep me posted on what you find :*
